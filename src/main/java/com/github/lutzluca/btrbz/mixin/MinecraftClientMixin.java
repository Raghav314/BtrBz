     * Dual injection into MinecraftClient#setScreen to support screen-aware rendering and safe callbacks.
     *
     * Why both HEAD and TAIL?
     *
     * - @HEAD: Updates ScreenInfo early so widgets see the correct screen during init.
     *   • Example issue: When rendering a module based on the current screen's menu (e.g. BazaarMenuType.Main
     *     in OrderLimitModule), injecting only at TAIL causes stale screen info — nothing renders in the main
     *     menu, but switching to another screen and back makes it appear unexpectedly.
     *
     * - @TAIL: Fires callbacks after the screen is fully initialized.
     *   • Example issue: If callbacks run too early (e.g. in FlipHelper), calling `close()` on the screen
     *     causes a NPE on `this.client`, since the screen isn't fully set up yet.
     * 
     * This is kinda wierd and sucks
