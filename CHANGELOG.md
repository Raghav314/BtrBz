### Fixed

- Some Item conversions

- `normalizeProductName` now handles last tokens that are already Roman numerals,
  uppercasing them correctly instead of leaving them in title case.
- Fixed modmenu being incorrectly declared as a required dependency.
  It is now compile-only, meaning the mod should work correctly with or
  without modmenu installed.
