Automatically handle navigation and data management after cancelling Bazaar orders.

**Actions:**

- **Reopen Bazaar Menu** - Return to main Bazaar after completing buy/sell orders

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Order Protection</strong></summary>

Guard against accidentally creating incorrectly priced Buy Orders or Sell Offers. Order Protection
validates an order when you open the buy/sell confirmation and can automatically block the order if
it looks like a mistake.

**Features:**

- Blocks orders that undercut existing orders by more than a configurable percentage (per-side
  sliders for Buy / Sell).
- Prevents creating Sell Offers that are below the current insta-buy price and Buy Orders that are
  above the current insta-sell price when enabled.
- Tooltip integration shows validation state and human-readable reason for blocked orders:
    - ✓ Safe: order passes validation
    - ✗ Blocked: setting order is prevented
    - ⚠ Overridden: validation blocked but Ctrl is held to override
- Hold Ctrl to override a blocked order and allow it to be placed.
- If the product / price could not be resolved it defaults to Safe
- Optional chat messages when a protection blocks an order.

**Configuration:**

- Enable/Disable Order Protection.
- Show Chat Messages — toggle system notifications when protections are triggered.
- Block Percentage Undercut — enable/disable percentage-based blocks.
- Max Buy Order Undercut (%) and Max Sell Offer Undercut (%) — slider values for percentage
  thresholds.
- Block Opposing Order Undercuts — prevents creating Sell Offers below the current buy (insta) price
  and Buy Orders above current sell (insta) price.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Order Highlighting</strong></summary>

Visually distinguish your tracked orders with color-coded highlights in the Orders screen.

- 🔴 **Red** - Orders that are Undercut (outbid)
- 🟡 **Gold** - Filled orders ready to claim

I could not figure out if 15b is really the right limit, I think there are some community discussion

real limit is either confirmed, or we get good information how the limit changes, the tracker will
be updated accordingly

## Developer Notes

A few things worth mentioning:

- **Widget Flickering:** You may notice modules/widgets flicker briefly when opening Item or
  ItemGroup pages. This is normal behavior - matching the menu type requires screen matching, which
  internally needs the screen to be fully loaded. The server must populate the screen inventory,
  which can take a few hundred milliseconds depending on latency.

- **Alpha State:** This mod is currently in alpha. Expect bugs! If you encounter issues, please
  report them at [Issues](https://github.com/LutzLuca/BtrBz/issues) or join
  the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HVaZA7PfUU).

- **Widget System:** Does the widget system suck? Yes. I hand-rolled it and it will (hopefully) be
  reworked at some point.

- **Color Palette:** Does the color palette kinda suck? Yes. I literally just used whatever colors I
  thought made sense for highlighting or what I liked in the moment. This results in a weird color
  palette that should be unified sometime.

- **Missing Images in Docs:** taking images that showcase a feature is more difficult than I
  thought, so I just did a few after that I did not really care anymore (sorry). Will probably add
  them in the future.

- **Missing Features:** As this mod currently is in alpha phase you feel it lacks some features,
  if that's the case either open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/LutzLuca/BtrBz/issues) or
  join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HVaZA7PfUU)
